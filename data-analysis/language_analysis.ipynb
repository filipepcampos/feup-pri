First, the troops assemble on the edge of bogs with names like Allen\\u2019s Creek, Scrub Swamp, and Atchall\\u2019s Swamp, standing at loose attention in the shade of a thick forest of beech, dogwood, and gum trees. Then they form two lines and march straight forward, from one side to the other. As absurd as it seems to the soldiers, marching headlong into cold mucky water, there is no other way of locating Booth and Herold. Incredibly, eighty-seven of these brave men will drown in their painstaking weeklong search for the killers.\\u201d \\u2015\",\n",
